## Getting started (Local Repo(for editting!))

To run a locally hosted version of this app you will first of all need to clone the repo to your own computer using:

1. Open up your favourite terminal and cd into a directory you're happy with this project living and use the following terminal command

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wasabi-p/event-app.git
   ```

2. CD into the new directory and use the following command to open it with your configured code editor. I recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the app

To run the dev build correctly you will need to configure the .env file which you can correctly, Please contact me for this file. It contains the correct URL, API keys and ClientID keys to be able to run everything locally and is provided in a .env file you will need to copy into the root directory of the app.

```bash
 npx expo start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

This particular app has only been developed in an android environment

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction)
